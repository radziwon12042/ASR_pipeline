# ASR_pipeline
ASR-based EEG preprocessing pipeline prototype for BCI applications

This repository contains the Python implementation of an ASR-based EEG
preprocessing pipeline developed as part of my BSc thesis
"Development of EEG Artifact Filtering Methods for Enhanced Brain-Computer Interface Performance".

The code builds on:
- ASRpy: https://github.com/DiGyt/asrpy
- clean_rawdata (MATLAB): https://github.com/sccn/clean_rawdata/tree/master
- PyPREP: https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep
- MNE-Python: https://mne.tools/

It is a research prototype tailored to an internal BCI framework and is not
a general-purpose, fully documented package. Some components may require
adaptation to run outside that environment.
